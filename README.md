3D Prosthesis Design Project

Currently 3D printing is contributing greatly to the manufacture of prostheses. In this project, the design of a prototype of an articulated upper limb prosthesis has been carried out. Said prototype is designed with the CAD tool, which can be printed with a 3D printer and articulated by means of various electronic elements (ESP32 card, protoboard, servo motors and jumpers) with Python programming. With the aim of creating a low-cost prosthesis using 3D impressions

# HARDWARE
- ESP32 (BLUETOOTH)
- MICRO SERVOS
- PROTOBOARD



# STL OR 3D DESIGN FILES
